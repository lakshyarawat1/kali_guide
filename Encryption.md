# Some important points about the cryptography and encryption

## Key Terms

- CipherText : The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data
- Cipher :  A method of encrypting or decrypting data.
- Plaintext : Data before encryption, could be a text or photograph
- Encryption : Transforming data into ciphertext
- Encoding : Form of data representation ( not encryption ) like base64
- Key : Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext
- Passphrase : A passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect the text
- Asymmetric encryption : Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt
- Symmetric encryption : Uses same keys to encrypt and decrypt
- Brute Force : Attacking cryptography by trying every different password
- Cryptanalysis : Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the algorithm

## Importance of encryption

- Whenever sensitive information is to be stored then it should be encrypted

## RSA ( Rivest Shamir Adleman ) encryption

### Main principle 

- RSA is based on the problem which says that it is very easy to multiply two prime numbers but very difficult to work out what prime numbers multiply together to make the number.
